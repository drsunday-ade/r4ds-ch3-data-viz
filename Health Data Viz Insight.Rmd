#' # Health-Driven Data Visualization with ggplot2
#' Rooted in insights from:
#' - *Health Equity Framework* (RWJF, WHO)
#' - *Business Model Generation* (Osterwalder & Pigneur)
#' - *Innovatorâ€™s DNA* (Dyer et al.)

#' ## 1. Setup: Libraries & Simulated Maternal Health Data
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)

set.seed(2025)
health_data <- tibble(
  region = rep(c("Urban", "Rural", "Remote"), each = 100),
  access = rep(c("High", "Medium", "Low"), each = 100),
  mortality = c(rnorm(100, 40, 5), rnorm(100, 80, 12), rnorm(100, 130, 18))
)

#' ## 2. Boxplot of Maternal Mortality by Region
#' Insight: Highlights health inequities driven by structural and geographic access
ggplot(health_data, aes(x = region, y = mortality, fill = region)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(
    title = "Maternal Mortality by Geographic Region",
    y = "Mortality Rate (per 100,000)",
    x = "Region"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

#' ## 3. Density Plot of Mortality by Access Level
#' Value: Helps visualize the entire distribution and overlap of risk
ggplot(health_data, aes(x = mortality, fill = access)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Mortality Risk Distribution by Access to Care",
    x = "Maternal Mortality Rate",
    fill = "Access Level"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

#' ## 4. Region vs Access Comparison (Interaction)
#' Purpose: Compare composite effects for intersectional insight
ggplot(health_data, aes(x = region, y = mortality, fill = access)) +
  geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge(0.8)) +
  labs(
    title = "Interaction of Region and Access Level on Mortality",
    y = "Mortality Rate", x = "Region"
  ) +
  theme_classic()

#' ## 5. Annotated Thresholds and Intervention Targets
#' Insight: Aligns visual targets with health system policy goals
threshold <- tibble(level = c(70, 110), label = c("WHO Target", "Global Alert"))

health_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = region, y = mortality)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = access), width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(data = threshold, aes(yintercept = level), linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  geom_text(data = threshold, aes(x = 2, y = level, label = label), vjust = -0.6, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Mortality Rates with WHO Benchmarks",
    y = "Rate per 100,000", x = "Region"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

#' ## 6. Narrative Insight:
#' - Use these visuals for grant reporting, community-engaged health research, and policymaking.
#' - Create storylines from region-access interactions to inform targeted interventions.
#' - Inspire system change by linking data with human impact stories.
